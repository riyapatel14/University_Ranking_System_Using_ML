University Ranking System Using Machine Learning

Project Overview
A machine learning project utilizing a Decision Tree Classifier to rank universities based on various performance metrics, enhancing the ability to identify top educational institutions.

Problem Identified 🚨
The proliferation of universities and educational institutions has created a need for an objective ranking system that can help students and stakeholders make informed decisions. Traditional ranking systems often rely on manual data collection and analysis, which can be time-consuming and subject to biases. There is a need for automated systems that can quickly and accurately rank universities based on multiple criteria, providing reliable information for decision-making.

🚀 Proposed Solution
Introducing an intelligent university ranking system using machine learning techniques.

What is This Project About?
This project leverages a Decision Tree Classifier to automatically rank universities based on various performance metrics. By analyzing data such as academic reputation, research output, faculty qualifications, student satisfaction, and employment outcomes, the system can assign a rank to each university.

How Does It Work?
The system uses a Decision Tree Classifier, trained on a labeled dataset of university metrics, to predict the rank of each university. The classifier analyzes features extracted from the data and determines the ranking based on these features.

Features:

Automated Ranking: Quickly and accurately ranks universities based on multiple criteria.
Machine Learning: Utilizes a Decision Tree Classifier for ranking.
Python-based: Developed using Python for easy integration and flexibility.
